# VR Fire Simulation
This repository serves as a place to store Unity and Arduino Assets (specifically scripts and scenes) for a PhD project.
This projet serves to test the accesibility of fire escapes for disabled wheel chair users in case of a fire. 
This simulation will also be done in VR, as to validate whether or not it serves as a valid replacement for escape drills/plans.
This will also be done using a Meta Quest Pro and motorized wheel chair (elevated off the ground) for controls.

>  Note that these scripts are scalable and, while confusing on their own, should be able to be used in the vast majority of fire drills/scenarios.
