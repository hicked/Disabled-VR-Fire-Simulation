# NEXT STEPS:
-   Create a basic environment for testing smoke and fire physics
-   Display environment on headset
-   Establish working flame and (mostly) smoke physics
-   Implement basic controls (teleportation)
-   Collect data from headset
    -   Eye Tracking
    -   Gyroscopes
        -   Head positionning
-   Modeling a more realistic environment
-   Photogrammetry (in order to apply to any area)

## Mechanical aspects
... To be determined
