## [v.0.0.1.1-prealpha] - 2024-04-05

**Author:** Antoine
**Plan:**
-   Use IR sensor to mesure the RPM or m/s of the wheel
-   Use a motor to read the current caused by the rotation of the wheel
-   Map the current -> wheel speed
-   IR is therefore just there to calibrate it
-   *Send* the wheel speed to Unity to map VR movement
-   *"Artificial ground"* for simulated friction, could also use the motors
-   Thrust bearing for rotation of wheel chair
